 # Weather app

Hi my name is Snir.
I'm here to explain to you about the project you're about to see.
This project was built to learn about using several types of API reading at the same time.
In the project you can see the weather in Tel Aviv, and five days ahead.
In addition, it is possible to search for cities in the world and add to the list of favorites and there watch the current weather.
Wish you a pleasant use :)
